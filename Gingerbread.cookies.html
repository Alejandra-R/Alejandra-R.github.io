<h3> For delicious gingerbread cookies cookies</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>1 Tablespoon of Grounded cinnamon.
</li>
		<li>1 Tablespoon of Ground Ginger</li>
		<li>3/4 teaspoon of Ground cloves </li>
		<li> 1/2 teaspoon of Nutmeg </li>
		<li>3/4 cup of Unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
		<li>1/2 cup of brown sugar</li> 
		<li>3/4 teaspoon of Baking soda (baking powder)</li>
		<li>3 1/4 cups of all purpose flour</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla essence</li>
		<li>1/2 cup of honey ( My personal preference)
			<p>	<!--this note goes on a different font and colour--> Now, the original recipe includes 1/2 cup of uncultured molasses, however, I decided to use honey as my base instead. This gives the cookies a sweet flavour that blends nicely with the spices (specially the ginger) and it is more healthy given that honey does not have as much sugar as molasses and is easier to find in any supermarket or convenience store.</p></li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Making the dough</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The first step is to mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl, these include:  Grounded Cinnamon, grounded ginger, grounded Nutmeg, grounded Cloves, flour, salt and baking soda. EASY! Now put this bowl aside.</li>
	<li>Next you have to mix the butter and the sugar together in a different bowl until they are all nice and fluffy!</li>
	<li>Take the bowl with the butter and sugar and add the egg, honey, and the vanilla essence and mix until they are homogenous.</li>
	<li>Add the dry ingredients that we left aside into the mix GRADUALLY. </li>
	<li>Now that the dough is ready, the next step is dividing it into two equal portions, wrap them in plastic wrap tightly and put them in the fridge. You must leave them there for at least two hours, or of you can, overnight.</li>
	<li>After two or more hours have passed and before you take out the cookie dough, preheat the oven at 350F and line your baking sheet with parchment paper. Then set it  aside for a minute.</li>
<li>Take out the dough from the oven and place it on a lightly floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough until it is as tick as you want it to be.</li>
<li>Use your favourite cookie cutters and transfer the cut shapes into the baking sheet covered with parchment paper.</li>

	<li>Bake the cookies for 8 to ten minutes (or more if necessary, depending on the thickness of the dough) until they are crisp on the sides and the top.</li>

	<li>Take them out of the oven and let them cool until they are at room temperature.</li>

<h2> Making the icing</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>The icing is unbelievably easy. You just need to whisk the milk, powdered sugar and vanilla essence until it is smooth. (This note goes on a different font and colour) Note: If the missing is too thin, add a little more powdered sugar. If it is too tick, add more milk! </li>
	<li>Separate the icing into different piping bags (or zip log bags with a little cut on one of the corners) and then add different colours of food colouring to each one.</li>

On the top row, from left to right: Black, yellow, blue. On the bottom row, from left to right: Green, pink, red." class="center">
