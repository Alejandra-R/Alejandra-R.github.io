			<h2>Tip 1:</h2><h2> Use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate</h2>
			<img src="dovile-ramoskaite--JeZAUkvhYU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Transparent bowl filled with pieces pf dark chocolate on a white table. On the table there are four pieces of chocolate , the edge of a small teapot, the edge of a white napkin with grey straps and a knife." class="center">
			<p>Dark chocolate is multiple times richer in antioxidants, fiber, iron, and zinc, among other nutrients. Look for dark chocolate with 70 percent cocoa or higher for maximum health benefits.</p>

			<h2>Tip 2:</h2><h2> Consider using coconut oil instead of butter.</h2>
			<img src="tijana-drndarski-dFoOWRT97_0-unsplash.jpg" alt="A coconut split in half with the insides of both half looking to opposite sides, on top of a grey wood table, with a dark blue and grey background." class="center">
			<p> Coconut oil may be more similar to butter than you think, specially when incomes to consistence, which means that it can make a proper dough just as well as butter. Like butter, coconut oil is solid at room temperature, but coconut oil is lower in sodium. It also contains lauric acid, a healthy saturated fat that has been found to help lower cholesterol as well as aid in weight loss.</p>

		<h2>Tip 3:</h2><h2> Use maple syrup or honey instead of white sugar</h2>
			<img src="alexander-mils-nesUgwNX3u4-unsplash.jpg" alt="On the left, the left side of a glass jar half filled with honey, next to it a small puddle of honey with a wooden spoon on it. On a wood textured background. " class="center">
			<p> Maple syrup and honey contain healthy vitamins and minerals rather than just empty calories. These sugar substitutes are also easier to digest, keeping your blood sugar more steady and preventing you from experiencing a crash in energy later on.</p>

		<h2>Here comes the weird one: </h2><h2>Use avocado</h2>
		<img src="irene-kredenets-AWMWcR3hQUg-unsplash.jpg" alt=" Two halves of an avocado facing up on a green background divided by a diagonal line that goes from the top right to the Botton left side. On the upper half a dark tone of green, on the bottom half a tone of green pushing towards yellow. Each half of the avocado over one tone of green." class="center">
			<p> Though avocado is definitely not the first thing you think about when picturing any dessert, you may be surprised to learn that this healthy fat can be used to make a frosting, pudding, or replace butter in recipes for cakes, brownies, breads, and other baked goods. This is the perfect chance to increase protein and get some additional nutrients in your body without risking any flavours.</p>

		<h2>Tip 5:</h2><h2> Switch from white flour to whole wheat flour.</h2>
			<img src="anshu-a-E5xgkSFan84-unsplash.jpg" alt="Black table filled with flour and other cooking utensils. On the top left a glass jar filled with different tips of flour. On the left there are two small jars one filled with whole wheat flour and the other filled with white flour." class="center">
			<p> White flours are made from heavily refined and processed wheat grain that is not exactly what you would call a part of an ideal diet. Whole wheat doesn't undergo the same processing and can bring some vital nutrition to your baked goods.</p>
